                    <div><h3 className="text-center text-white mt-2">Hi. My name is Marcin Parda. I am 23 years old and a React developer with one year of commercial experience. From the teenage years I was interested in creating games.</h3></div>
                    <div className="mt-2"><h3 className="text-center text-white">At the beginning, they were board games, because my home did not have access to the Internet, and thus no programming materials. The municipal library also did not have any items on programming.</h3></div>
                    <div className="mt-2"><h3 className="text-center text-white">At the age of eleven, I started to play around changing graphics and sounds in games and see what happens. I liked it so much that it didn't take long until the first game development program appeared on my disk.</h3></div>
                    <div className="mt-2"><h3 className="text-center text-white">I already knew then that I wanted to deal with programming or professional running in the future. Years passed and I honed myself in the art of creating games.</h3></div>
                    <div className="mt-2"><h3 className="text-center text-white">At the end of high school I became interested in creating websites in javascript. I got so caught up in it that I abandoned my earlier plans to become a Frontend Developer. From that day on, I was able to complete my IT studies and find a satisfactory job, in which I have been working since July 2020.</h3></div>
                    <div className="mt-2"><h3 className="text-center text-white">I have also recently been training in UI design. It is a process that I enjoy a lot. In my professional life, I strive to become a programmer and designer in my country that is recognizable and well remembered by my coworkers.</h3></div>
                </h3>
